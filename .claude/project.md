## Important Decisions

<!-- TODO: Document key architectural/business decisions -->
<!-- Example:
- SQLite for MVP (zero cost, easy setup)
- No phone verification for MVP (simpler auth flow)
- Feature X is core (not a nice-to-have)
- Using library Y for Z (reason)
-->

## Technical Gotchas

<!-- TODO: Document project-specific gotchas that will save debugging time -->
<!-- Example:
- Leaflet needs dynamic import (SSR issues)
- Model X has no direct relation to Y (goes through Z model)
- Admin panel uses shared layout - pages have NO headers
- Client dashboard pages each manage their own branded header
-->
