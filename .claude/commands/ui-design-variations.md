Generate 5 distinct visual design variations of a React component while preserving functionality.

**How to use:**
1. Select the component code you want design variations for
2. Run `/ui-design-variations`
3. I'll create 5 different styled versions

**The 5 Variation Types:**

1. **🪟 Minimalist Glass**
   - Frosted glass effect with `backdrop-blur`
   - Subtle transparency
   - Clean, modern aesthetic
   - Light shadows

2. **🏢 Elevated Corporate**
   - Strong shadows and layered appearance
   - Professional, structured layout
   - Clear hierarchy
   - Solid backgrounds

3. **📱 Modern Compact**
   - Space-efficient, mobile-first design
   - Tight spacing
   - Optimized for small screens
   - Minimal decoration

4. **📐 Outlined Border-Focused**
   - Border-centric design
   - Minimal fills
   - Strong outlines
   - Clear separation

5. **🌈 Colorful Gradient**
   - Vibrant gradients
   - Bold color choices
   - Eye-catching
   - Playful aesthetics

**Preserved Across All Variations:**
- ✅ All functionality and props
- ✅ Accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- ✅ Component structure
- ✅ Event handlers
- ✅ Responsive behavior

**Output Format:**

Each variation includes:
- Complete component code
- Description of design choices
- When to use this variation
- Implementation notes

**Example Use Cases:**
- Exploring different visual directions
- A/B testing designs
- Client presentations
- Finding the right aesthetic for Atrio's brand

**Tech Stack:**
- shadcn/ui components
- Tailwind CSS
- Event color theming (primary, secondary, accent, background)
- Light/dark mode support

**Note:** This is for exploration and learning. For production, choose one variation that fits Atrio's brand and stick with it for consistency.

**Perfect for:**
- New components where aesthetic isn't decided
- Learning different Tailwind/shadcn patterns
- Rapid prototyping
- Design discussions with stakeholders
